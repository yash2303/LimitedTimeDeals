## Problem Statement
You are a budding entrepreneur who devised an idea to build an e-commerce giant like Amazon, Flipkart, Walmart, etc. As part of this ambition, you want to build a platform to duplicate the concept of Limited Time Deals.

### Limited Time Deals
* A limited-time deal implies that a seller will put up an item on sale for a limited period, for example - 2 hours, and will keep a maximum limit on the number of items that would be sold as part of that deal.
* Users cannot buy the deal if the deal time is over.
* Users cannot buy if other users have already bought all the items in the deal.
* Users can buy up to one item as part of the deal.

* The task is to create APIs to enable the following operations
* Create a deal with the price, end time(optional) and number of items to be sold as part of the deal.
* End a deal.
* Update a deal to increase the number of items or end-time.
* Claim a deal (Basically, creating an order. No need to take care of item price or payment).

## Guidelines
* Document and communicate your assumptions in README.
* Create a working solution with production-quality code.
* Use an external database like Postgres/MySQL or any NoSQL database
* Define and Create APIs to support the operations mentioned above
* Write a few unit tests for the most important code

### What are we looking for?
* Your approach to the solution
* How you write code in terms of readability and maintainability
* Usage of best practices
* Testing skills

You are expected to write code for the complete application and build at least one end-to-end feature. However, a complete working solution is NOT expected.
